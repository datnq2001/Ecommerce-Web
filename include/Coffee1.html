        The darker the coffee is roasted, the more complete the flavor becomes. Roasting coffee is a process that demands delicacy from the hands and an understanding of each type of coffee bean from the artisan.
        Small fires during roasting leave the coffee underdeveloped and more bitter, while over-roasting leads to burnt flavors, losing the superior qualities it originally possessed. Throughout the roasting process, nutrients like proteins and enzymes accumulate inside, forming the essence of the coffee, making it richer and smoother.
