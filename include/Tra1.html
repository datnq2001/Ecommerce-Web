        Tea plants grown in different regions with varying altitudes and climates yield different types of tea. The complexity
        arises from within, from the unique chemical composition and structure that only the tea plant possesses. Understanding
        this, to preserve the freshness of flavor and retain the best nutrients, we often pluck one bud and two leaves early
        in the morning. Subsequently, the production process to create high-quality tea products is meticulously executed.

        Phuc Long understands that to create a delicious cup of tea, precision is required from the process of plucking tea
        leaves to roasting and brewing. When roasting tea, the fire must be carefully controlled, and when brewing, the water
        temperature must be just right. Now, holding a cup of fragrant tea in hand, savoring the traditional tea flavor is
        an expression of feelings towards life, appreciating the natural taste emanating from tea leaves, feeling tranquil
        amidst the hustle and bustle.
